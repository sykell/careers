# Crowd-powered compliance platform

## Background
Public institutions often struggle to monitor legal compliance among local merchants due to high task fragmentation, limited personnel and tight budgets.
We want to explore a tech-enabled, crowd-powered solution: 

> A platform where consumers can report potential compliance violations (i.e. a restaurant not offering reusable packaging alternatives). 
> The data will be channeled to the correct public authorities, helping them prioritize inspections and improve regional oversight.

## The Challenge

You are tasked with designing a feasible MVP solution and presenting it to the internal tech team (and potentially management).

Your goal is to:
- Define a high-level architecture and describe the major system components.
- Identify key technological decisions (e.g. frontend/backend choices, data storage, notification systems, APIs, etc.) and justify your reasoning.
- Propose a simple data model to handle reports, users, authorities, and merchants.
- Outline how the system identifies the competent authority based on report data.
- Consider how to handle sensitive or false reports (e.g. moderation, flagging, thresholds).
- Describe a basic dashboard or insights module for public authorities.
- Select relevant public data (e.g. registry of businesses, geospatial jurisdiction data) and explain how you’d integrate it.
- Touch briefly on how you’d scale or iterate the product beyond MVP.
- Highlight any non-functional requirements you’d consider (e.g. security, anonymity, performance, accessibility).

## Deliverables
- A short technical brief (max 2–3 pages) that outlines your solution and rationale. 
- Verbal pitch simulation (prepare as if you’ll walk a team of engineers through your proposal).
- Roadmap for the MVP development, including key milestones and timelines.
- (Optional) Diagrams, system architecture, data flow, user journey.

## What We’re Evaluating

- Technical decision-making and system thinking 
- Product empathy and understanding of civic challenges
- Communication clarity and stakeholder alignment	
- Creativity and pragmatism in an ambiguous context	
- Risk identification and tradeoff analysis

## Notes

- Assume this is a greenfield project, and you can shape key decisions.	
- This is not about perfect code or wireframes: we’re looking for your approach, prioritization, and leadership.
