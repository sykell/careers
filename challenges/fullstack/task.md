# Test task

## Introduction

This test task is for the Full-Stack Developer position with a front-end focus. 
While your primary responsibility will be front-end development, you will also integrate with back-end services.

This exercise has two goals:

* **For us:** To evaluate your production-quality code, API design reasoning, and overall development approach.
* **For you:** To experience the day-to-day work at Sykell through a realistic project.

## Code and project ownership

This is purely an exercise; we have no intention of using your submission in production. 
You retain full ownership of your work and may license it as you see fit. 
If you choose not to move forward with us, you’re free to open-source it or include it in your portfolio.

## Areas of focus

We will evaluate your submission on:

* **Front-end**
    * UI must be a React Web application
    * Responsive design (desktop and mobile)
    * TypeScript

* **Back-end**
    * Go (Golang)
    * Framework of your choice (e.g., Gin, Echo, etc.)
    * MySQL for data storage

* **General**

    * Reproducible builds (use your preferred vendoring/packaging system)
    * Consistent error handling and reporting (no crashes under non-critical conditions)
    * API request to backend must use authorization mechanism.
    * Automated front-end tests covering few happy-path scenarios
    * Total implementation time should not exceed 8 hours (feel free to spread this across multiple days)

> **Note:** As this role is front-end focused, the quality and completeness of your React/TypeScript code will carry greater weight.

# Task Description

Build a web application that accepts a website URL as input, crawls it and displays key information about that page.

**Back-end data collection (per URL):**

* HTML version
* Page title
* Count of heading tags by level (H1, H2, etc.)
* Number of internal vs. external links
* Number of inaccessible links (those returning 4xx or 5xx status codes)
* Presence of a login form

**Front-end requirements (high → low priority):**

1. **URL Management**

    * Add URLs for analysis
    * Start/stop processing on selected URLs

2. **Results Dashboard**

    * Paginated, sortable table (columns: Title, HTML Version, #Internal Links, etc.)
    * Column filters and a global search box (fuzzy or prefix matching)

3. **Details View**

    * Click a row to open a detail page showing:

        * Bar or donut chart of internal vs. external links
        * List of broken links with status codes

4. **Bulk Actions**

    * Re-run analysis or delete selected URLs via checkboxes

5. **Real-Time Progress**

    * Display crawl status for each URL (queued → running → done / error)



# How to submit test task

1. Create a **public GitHub repository** and commit your code there.
2. Include a **README.md** with clear instructions to build and run your application.
3. Email the repository link to **[careers@sykell.com](mailto:careers@sykell.com)**.
